When you define the @JMSDestinationDefinition for the MBD, you also need to provide the destinationName property.
This name is then used by Producers and Consumers to look-up the destination.


@MessageDriven(mappedName = "jms/javaee7/Topic", activationConfig = {
@ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName  = "acknowledgeMode",
                          propertyValue = "Auto-acknowledge"),
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName  = "messageSelector",
                                  propertyValue = "orderAmount > 1000")
})
@JMSConnectionFactoryDefinition (name = "jms/javaee7/ConnectionFactory", className = "javax.jms.ConnectionFactory")
@JMSDestinationDefinition (name = "jms/javaee7/Topic", className = "javax.jms.Topic", interfaceName = "javax.jms.Topic", 
                           destinationName = "Topic1") // <----------------destinationName is Topic1
public class ExpensiveOrderMDB implements MessageListener {


// Looks up the administered objects
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (ConnectionFactory) jndiContext.lookup("jms/javaee7/ConnectionFactory");
Destination topic = (Destination) jndiContext.lookup("Topic1"); //<-------------------destinationName used by Producer for lookup

########Running Produce from command line##############
When you invoke standalone Producer class from the command line, you need to specify the fully quailified classname as well as the path to glassfish libs

java -cp "target/classes:/Users/vkommara/Downloads/glassfish4/glassfish/lib/*" github.vikram.javaee.jms.OrderProducer 500

For this example we use the Queue as the destination for messages
#########Difference between Queue and Topic############
Queue:
Point-to-point model
Only one consumer gets the message
Messages have to be delivered in the order sent
A JMS queue only guarantees that each message is processed only once.


Topic:
Publish/subscribe model
Multiple clients subscribe to the message
There is no guarantee messages have to be delivered in the order sent
There is no guarantees that each message is processed only once. -- As this can be sensed from the model 
The Topic, have multiple subscribers and there is a chance that the topic does not know all the subscribers. The destination is unknown.
The subscriber / JMS client needs to the active when the messages are produced by the producer, unless the subscription was a durable subscription.
